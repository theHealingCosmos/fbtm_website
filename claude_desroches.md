"I have been a member of First Berlin Toastmasters since September of 1997. Knowledge and experience I acquired through Toastmasters was readily applied in my professional life as a seminar leader, university lecturer, and professional speaker. I have had the opportunity to practice my leadership and communications skills as a board member as well as District Officer. The insights gained through the years with Toastmasters have been invaluable to both my professional as well as my private life. I learned how to say no, manage my time better, motivate/persuade/inspire and lead others. Participating in contests at all levels from club all the way to district level taught me how to deal with stress and opened up a whole new world of opportunities, allowing me to me and compete with and against formidable opponents. My trophy case is full of memories and certificates, but what I cherish most are the experiences, the impressions, and the friendships and bonds made with fellow Toastmasters throughout the world.

If I have learned anything, it is that there is always something new to learn, more to give and even more to receive from fellow Toastmasters."


		Claude Desroches.
