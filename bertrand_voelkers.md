This page contains Bertrand Völkers  success story from First Berlin Toastmasters.

„For me most important at Toastmasters is to get new experiences and transfer these new skills into my professional or private life. I learned from being Contest Chair at the district conference 2014 (continental Europe): 

1. I can be relaxed, happy, smiling and express these feelings even under seemingly overwhelming stressing situations
2. If I am chairing an event speakers truly appreciate it when I am relaxed and confident and do my best to support them.  
   The audience also appreciates this.
3. When I ask my wife to support me in stressful situations she is happy to do this. This led me to volunteer for a very important presentation at a European Sales conference in May of 2014. Not only did I give a successful presentation during this conference I also organized and hosted it. I received superb feedback.  This customer focused event resulted in terrific sales results.  

Thanks to Toastmasters, 2014 was the year where I felt confident and truly stepped out of my comfort zone.
