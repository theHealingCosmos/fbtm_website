A Journey of Healing

Can you imagine having a speech impediment and ending up on center stage as a contestant in the world  nals of a prestigious speak- ing competition, speaking in front of 2,000 people in Las Vegas? That at was me.

In 2010, I was living in Berlin, Germany, when an American friend invited me along to a Toastmasters meeting. I was addicted from the get-go. Not because I liked the idea of speaking, but because I loved the people.  They were warm, friendly and welcoming.  The nurturing environment immediately appealed to me: a nurturing environment that would unlock my voice and change the direction of my life.

Only 18 months after joining Toastmasters, I competed in the World Championship of Public Speaking (the  finals of the International Speech Contest). Today, my professional keynote speech shares my journey from the fear of delivering my Ice Breaker to the empowerment of delivering my  finals speech and the reality of being disqualified from the  finals. Yes, disqualified!

Even the disqualication helped me grow and made me realize that the reward was not the award; the reward was the connection forged with the audience. You see, when you have a message that you are desperate to get across, often there is a journey of healing or self-realization involved, a journey that many in your audience will identify with. My message in my contest  finals speech was, “Our failings don’t make us a failure.” With the help of my Teddy Bear, Wodwik, I talked about the low self-esteem that having a speech impediment can evoke and how that had affected my entire life.
 
                          
“My speech impediment left scars inside me that shaped my whole life.  The very same thing, my speech impediment, was the reason for the biggest achievement of my entire life.”

After the competition, I gave up my job in television — where I’d often felt like a failure despite having worked at some of the great broadcasting companies, like the BBC. Instead of heading into a mid-life crisis like many of my friends, I headed into a career change that has taken me from speech impediment to professional speaker.

 The career isn’t the only thing that has been affected. Fundamental feelings have changed in me. I feel happier with who I am. I used to compare myself to others and always came up short; I don’t do that anymore. I am working in a  field that I’m passionate about, one where I use all my strengths and I feel confident about what I deliver. I am benefitting from deeper relationships, with colleagues, friends, and even my two teenage daughters. You see, what I discovered was that when you break free from the constraints of your own mind and the baggage you are carrying from your past, you can overcome the challenges of the present and reap the benefits and opportunities of the future.
 
 Toastmasters unwrapped my authentic voice and now the best thing about what I do is I get to help others unwrap theirs.
