From Guest to Leading Toastmasters in 18 Countries
       
„In my experience it is the gentle support of its members that grants success to every individual member of First Berlin Toastmasters. After a warm welcome in 2004 I felt encouraged to pursue my Competent Toastmaster award (equivalent to the current Competent Communicator award) in my first year. Enjoying the Toastmasters’ ride the club’s members elected me to become their President the following year. My learning never stopped and the support of my fellow club members allowed me to follow leadership roles beyond club level. This led me to the honour of leading District 59 and its 18 member countries (now split into District 59 and 95) as District Governor in 2010-2011 to achieve President’s Distinguished District status. Taking on new roles is always challenging but it feels wonderful. It is rewarding to learn new skills while being supported by a wonderful group of people who share similar interests with you. Having seen a big part of the Toastmasters world I still feel at home at First Berlin Toastmasters. 

Thanks to you all.“

	Benjamin Brühl
